# IPS Viewer

An online viewer for the International Patient Summary (IPS). Currently hosted at https://www.ipsviewer.com

## What It Does?

This repository contains a node.js (JavaScript) express server for a webpage. That webpage allows users to paste in a JSON formatted IPS document according to the standard and view: 

- Textual display of narrative sections
- Machine readable entries with a simple card view

This tool is not a validator of the IPS standard. The IPS standard is currently available at https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/

## Examples

Some samples IPS files (in JSON) are included in the "samples" folder. Note that these samples were collected during public connectathons. They may (or may not) validate according to the [IPS Standard](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/).

## How to Run Locally?

1. Make sure node/npm is installed on server/desktop 
2. Clone this repository
3. Install dependencies (```npm i```)
4. Start express server (```node app.js```)

By default, app will start with HTTP hosting to localhost. If you want to serve using HTTPS, create a certs folder with key, crt and ca-bundle files. Then change the corresponding filenames in app.js
